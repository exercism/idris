This tutorial is intended as a brief introduction to the language,
and is aimed at readers already familiar with a functional language such as Haskell or OCaml.
In particular, a certain amount of familiarity with Haskell syntax is assumed,
although most concepts will at least be explained briefly. The reader is also assumed to have
some interest in using dependent types for writing and verifying systems software.
